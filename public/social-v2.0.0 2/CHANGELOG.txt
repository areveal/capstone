Version 2.0.0 - 23.05.2014

1. Updated CORE:
	- Complete refactor of the assets structure into 3 levels of assets: Libraries (or Frameworks), 3rd party Plugins and custom Components (collections of custom assets and markup);
	- Components are responsible for controlling the behaviour and styling throughout the template;
	- Plugins and libraries used by components were removed from the components folders and better organized and contained into more logical paths:
		1. assets/library - libraries and core frameworks like Bootstrap, jQuery, jQuery UI, Modernizr etc;
		2. assets/plugins - jQuery Plugins, Bootstrap Plugins, etc;
		3. assets/components - collections of JavaScript & styling;

2. Added PHP Version:
	- Exposes a basic templating system with a main bootstrap file, header, footer, pages and various configuration files.
	- The PHP version dynamically handles the loading of:
		- Styling (Skins);
		- JavaScript files;
		- Pages & sub-pages;
	- PHP Menu Builder: 
		- Easily create sidebar menus directly from a config file, simple or collapsibles, with unlimited menu levels, custom icons (1600+) and various options - can even include any custom content from other files automatically;

3. Updated documentation:
	- Added comprehensive guides:
		1. Getting started with the HTML version
			- Includes an overview of the guide's sections, the folder structure, layout & menus, CSS & LESS and the assets structure explained;
		2. Getting started with the PHP Version
			- Includes the folder and file structure, template system, configurations, using the menu builder, dynamic loading of scripts, switching skins;
	- Added meta information for all the plugins, libraries and components used in the template such as Name, Description, Version used and for 3rd party assets links to Official Website & Documentation;
	- Further extended the documentation with dozens of examples;
	- Organized Components in various groups by different filters, type, scope, modules and others;
	- Component details include:
		- 3rd party assets (plugins & libraries) used by the component;
		- Examples
			- Quick Preview and Source;
			- Resources that contains information about 3rd party assets used within each example;
			- Instructions for loading the Styles & Scripts used for each example;
